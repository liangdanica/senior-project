  <h2>At a Crossroads</h2>
  <p>As the oldest child in a family of first-generation Mexican immigrants, Jonathan was the go-to person for all things tech that ranged from making a CD with music to installing a printer. He took this unsaid responsibility with pride and passion, fueling a drive to pursue computer science.</p>
  <br>
  <p>His decision to study computer science was also inspired by his father, who had earned the equivalent of an associate’s degree back in Mexico for Computer Science but was unable to continue his education. “In a way, it was kind of like finishing off what my dad had started,” the 6th-year Computer Science student said thoughtfully.</p>

  	<b>-Jonathan, 6th Year, Computer Science</b>
  <p>
  <br>
  <p>However, Jonathan struggled academically in his classes. He questioned if he had chosen the right major. “I would definitely see my classmates understand the language faster, pick it up faster and I would talk to some of them and they would have previous experience with like programming and coding.... whereas I had just began like a quarter ago,” he said. In his mind he struggled more than the “average computer science student.”</p>
  <br>
  <p>Jonathan attributes some of his academic struggles to the individualistic culture of the computer science culture. He notes that it is more likely that students will go “unnoticed.” He has also realized that stereotypes about computer scientists have impacted his own behavior. “Because I would think, engineers are shy in general or tend to be quiet, I limited myself in being more open or asking for help.”</p>
  <br>
  <p>It didn’t help that he felt unable to connect with his peers. As he observed that his peers would gradually form established groups of friends in the major and pair up in group projects, he saw himself as an outsider, one who would eventually join whatever group that needed an extra person.</p>
  <br>
  <p>It was difficult to find other students from similar backgrounds like himself. “I was always like kind of one of the only – if not the few – Hispanic or brown students in the classroom,” Jonathan said.</p>
  <br>
  <p>In hopes of finding his support system, he checked out major-related clubs but felt a lack of belonging due to the lack of diversity. “As much as I wanted to have more experiences with my major, the environment for me, I don’t know... I don’t want to say unwelcoming – it's not like they were pushing me away – but at the same time, I didn’t really feel like I fit into those groups at that time,” he reflected.</p>
  <br>
  <p>In search of other people of color in computer science, he sought out spaces for people of color on campus. In these spaces, he was less likely to find other computer science students. Many of the engineering students he would meet were not computing students. Jonathan found himself at a crossroads – unable to find people he could relate to both culturally and academically. </p>
